This has been a long due task for me. I have been thinking of starting my blog for several years, and honestly, I do start out in many different ways. But, they all ended up in the same way, for the same reason. All had the same problem that I was not passionate enough to keep them going.

So leaving the past behind, this is my another try and hopefully the final one. I plan to keep this one alive for the rest of my life and would love to hear from you as a reader or writer, how you started your journey? How did you overcome your fear? And what was the primary motivation that inspired you to do it? 

I know the title of this blog post is a bit misleading but whoever has come down here is looking for the same push I have been searching for, the same kick that needs to get us off the ground and get started. If you ask me, there is no one answer; you just need to find it in your heart and make a strong determination to commit to it. 

For me, it was a long day of discussions about the future and a mix many other things at the office and just made me say __"F**K IT.. LET'S JUST START IT!!"__ and here I'm writing *my first blog post in the back seat of a cab on my way home*.
